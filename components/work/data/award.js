            "Selected from six category winners, Pubarun Basu (India, 19 years-old) has won Youth Photographer of the Year 2021 for his image No Escape from Reality. In the photograph the shadows of railings projected onto curtains create the illusion of cage bars from behind which a pair of hands is seen as if trying to break through. The illusion of shadows and hands gesture convey a sense of entrapment shared by so many across the world this past year. For his win Basu receives Sonyâ€™s digital imaging kit and global exposure.",
