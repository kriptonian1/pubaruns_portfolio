            "description": "In the state of Maharashtra in India, an 800 years old tradition still finds its way in the modern world. In the month of Asadh, the agrarian community of Maharashtra set out on a pilgrimage after sowing the seeds of a new harvest. As the blue haze slowly dissipates from the night sky, thousands of white clothed 'Warkaris' start pouring into a barren land surrounded by lush greenery. Having travelled a couple hundred kilometres, they finally gather together to prepare the stage for their grand ceremonial practices. The unwavering devotion towards their deity ' Vithalla ' finds its expression through their unique way of life.",

The sense of community is deeply rooted in their cultural fabric - something that constitutes the very notion of their identity. Looking into their eyes, one can feel the strong connection of spirituality that they share with their deity. The women, usually shy in their household, find an opportunity to express their blithely spirits through fun games, devotional songs and so much more. The men, dressed in all white, carry the palkhi of their religious saint on their shoulders and join in on the musical celebrations. Therein lies a vivid transformation in the lives of these devotees.",
