Although a stigma surrounding the lower caste tribes continues to loom upon the people, the journey to freedom for the Ramnamis has been resolved into a peaceful conclusion. As a result, the younger generation finds it unnecessary to follow the customs that were once institutionalized by their elders. The tattoos have started fading away with time, as have their significance. Yet, they remain etched on the skins as a permanent reminder of the struggle of independence of the Ramnamis.",
