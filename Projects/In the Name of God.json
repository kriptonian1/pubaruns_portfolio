As members of the lower caste, the tribal people were denied entry into temples and treated as untouchables throughout centuries. Following a series of events that took away the freedom of practicing their religion, the tribe was pushed to the limits of socio-political hegemonic tyranny. The indigenous identity of this ethnic group was stripped off of them by the upper caste communities. The late 19th century witnessed the rise of a hero in the name of Parasuram, who emerged from the ashes of mutiny and started the Ramnami sect as an act of defiance against the casteist regime. The name of ' Ram ' was tattooed on the bare skin of all the members of the tribe, to prove a silent but powerful message that God is omnipresent.",

Although a stigma surrounding the lower caste tribes continues to loom upon the people, the journey to freedom for the Ramnamis has been resolved into a peaceful conclusion. As a result, the younger generation finds it unnecessary to follow the customs that were once institutionalized by their elders. The tattoos have started fading away with time, as have their significance. Yet, they remain etched on the skins as a permanent reminder of the struggle of independence of the Ramnamis.",
