The walls of these mega structures have witnessed centuries of royal battles that have shaped the course of the nation's history. It is believed that the forts and palaces of Rajasthan were built on the principles of 'Vastu Shastra', the ancient Indian science of architecture. The intricately carved out designs exhibit the harmonious confluence of the Rajput and Mughal styles of architecture. Away from the imperial glitter lies the painted towns of Shekhawati, home to the elegant havelis with their vividly colourful fresco walls. The dynamic symmetry, the progressive patterns and the perfect balance of different elements induce a visual wonder in the eyes of the viewers. The architecture of Rajasthan weaves together a unique fabric that connects the people with their culture and heritage." ,

            "description": "  The history of Shekhawati is composed of ancient myths and fables that shape the modern-day narrative of its culture. What once used to be a majestic desert kingdom has been transformed into a collection of humble towns, each with its own charm. Living in these towns are fascinating characters that bring alive the tales of the bygone era. In my explorations, I have encountered such inimitable personalities whose stories have given me a unique perspective towards the cultural nuances that constitute the notion of the state. My project is a mere representation of this collective experience.",
